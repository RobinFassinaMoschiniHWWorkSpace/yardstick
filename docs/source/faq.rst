**Question:** What is the latest release?

The latest rfcat release may be found here.

**Question:** Why doesn't the LED turn on when I plug in my YARD Stick One?

Yes. This is the expected behavior of RfCat firmware. The LED only illuminates while data is being transferred in transmit or receive mode.

**Question:** My firmware isn't running, how do I enter bootloader mode?

Bootloader mode can be triggered by connecting pins 7 and 9 on the P1 expansion header.
